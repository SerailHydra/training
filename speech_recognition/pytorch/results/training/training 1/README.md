This run produced our first model.

Training dataset is:
	LibriSpeech train_clean-100, train_clean-360, train_other-500
Validation dataset is:
	LibriSpeech val_clean, val_other
Test dataset is:
	LibriSpeech test_clean
	
Epoch time: took 15-20 hours to train.
Batch size, learning rate, annealing rate were varied and experimented upon.
In "training 2" we fix the parameters.
